# Games-Database-Manager

* With this program you can keep track of games that you store on various storage devices.  
* You only need the .exe file from the bin\debug folder, to run the app.   
* Golden means that it has a picture preview    
* The data is stored in the file "database.grecs" that must be inside the folder of the app.     
* If you dont have a database, first fill your records and then click "save all changes".      
* If you already have, when opening the app first click "Load database".    
* I'd recommend to also to put adhesive labels on your storage devices, to help you keep track of them.
